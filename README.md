# CIFAR-10 Image Classification with Streamlit Web App

An end-to-end deep learning project for classifying images into 10 categories from the CIFAR-10 dataset.  
The project covers the full ML lifecycle ‚Äî from data preprocessing and model training to deployment as an interactive Streamlit web application.

## üöÄ Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to:
- Build and train a custom **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** for image classification.
- Use **data augmentation** and **training callbacks** to improve performance and prevent overfitting.
- Save and reload trained models for future retraining or deployment.
- Deploy a **Streamlit web app** where users can upload images and instantly receive classification predictions.

## üñ• Streamlit Web App
The Streamlit app allows users to:
1. Upload an image (JPG/PNG).
2. See real-time predictions with confidence scores.
3. Test model performance interactively.

**Run the app locally:**
```bash streamlit run app.py
